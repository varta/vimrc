Vim configuration options for LibSylph
======================================

This directory contains several settings files for Vim that make working with
LibSylph easier, such as syntax highlighting, ... Copy them to your $VIMHOME
to install them.

Authors
-------
* Frank Erens (LibSylph adaptations)
* Ken Shan (original C++ highlighting file for vim)

Modelines
---------
Vim allows you to specify per-file settings in the files themselves through
something called a "modeline". Below is the recommended modeline for all 
C++ files in LibSylph:

// vim: syntax=cpp11:ts=4:sts=4:sw=4:sta:et:tw=80:nobk

For testcases, use this line:

// vim: syntax=cpp11:ts=4:sts=4:sw=4:sta:et:tw=80:nobk:path+=,../../src/

Simply put these as the last lines of your file.
