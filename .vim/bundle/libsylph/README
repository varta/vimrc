Vim configuration options for LibSylph
======================================

This directory contains several settings files for Vim that make working with
LibSylph easier, such as syntax highlighting, ... Copy them to your $VIMHOME
to install them.

Additional plugins
------------------
You might want to install the VimProjects plugin to get some of the
project-specific settings for LibSylph to load automatically when you open a
file in the tree. Download the script from http://git.io/UCarwQ and install to
your $VIMHOME/plugins directory.

For other useful but non-mandatory plugins, check out the following url:

Authors
-------
* Frank Erens (LibSylph adaptations)
* Ken Shan (original C++ highlighting file for vim)

Modelines
---------
Vim allows you to specify per-file settings in the files themselves through
something called a "modeline". Below is the recommended modeline for all 
C++ files in LibSylph:

// vim: ts=4:sts=4:sw=4:sta:et:tw=80:nobk

For testcases, use this line:

// vim: ts=4:sts=4:sw=4:sta:et:tw=80:nobk:path+=,../../src/

Simply put these as the last lines of your file.
